        <article><h2>Learn</h2>The term "vegetarian," as applied to those who abstain from all flesh food, but not necessarily from such animal products as eggs, milk, and cheese, appears to have come into existence over fifty years ago, at the time of the founding of the Vegetarian Society in 1847.<br> Until that date no special name had been appropriated for the reformed diet system, which was usually known as the "Pythagorean" or "vegetable diet," as may be seen by a reference to the writings of that period.<br> Presumably, it was felt that when the movement grew in volume, and was about to enter on a new phase, with an organised propaganda, it was advisable to coin for it an original and distinctive title. </article>

        <article><h2> Recipes</h2>Most vegetables should be put into fresh, rapidly-boiling water, and if cooked in             uncovered vessels, they will retain a better color, as high heat destroys their color. In no instance              permit them to steep in the warm water, as this toughens them, and in some instances destroys both color        and flavor.<br>
        The salt hardens the water, and also sets the color in the vegetable. For peas and beans do not add salt to the water until they are nearly done, as they do not boil tender so readily in hard water.
        Corn should not be boiled in salt water, as the salt hardens the outer covering of skin and makes it tough. Cook the vegetables rapidly till perfectly tender, but no longer. </article>
