    <p>The word “vegetarian” doesn't just define a diet—it's a way of life. We pride ourselves in supporting a mindful lifestyle, which includes eating ethically and sustainably.<br>

        <br>As of 2017, we’re excited to debut Vegetarian Times as an online magazine. Although we have a fresh look and feel, we are still the resource readers have known and loved for the past 40 years. Here you'll find reliable recipes, useful information, and a welcoming home for established vegetarians and flexitarians alike.</p></article>
